Hacktoberfest Contributor Guide ðŸŽƒ
Hacktoberfest 2022 is finally here, and we're pretty excited about it.
Open source developers also play a crucial role in making our API's accessible and compatible with different ecosystems.
We think it's a great time to encourage, recognise and reward developers in the community who dedicate their time to creating for others.

What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is an annual festival hosted by DigitalOcean that takes place in the month of October to celebrate the open source community.
As part of this 31-day celebration, contributors and open source maintainers are encouraged to work on open source projects and win swag to mark the occasion.
